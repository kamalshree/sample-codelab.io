# Choose your own adventure!

If you have completed [Lab A03](./A03-after-apply-styling.md) then you're ready to choose your own adventure!

Lab A03 is just a personal tab app that more or less runs the original Northwind Orders application. Not only is this boring, but it really doesn't harness the power of Microsoft Teams!

These labs all build on Lab A03 (or, if you're brave, [Lab B04](../bespoke/B04-after-apply-styling.md)). So if you don't have that working, [go do that first](../index.md#path-a-start-with-azure-ad) and then come back.

Here are the extended lab adventures we have in store for you. Do one or do 'em all!
